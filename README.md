# Query Optimizer Benchmark

There will be a subdir for each database system supported.

## Purpose of the Benchmark
The main aim of the benchmark is to test a database system ability to compile same query plans for equivalent SQL commands (with different syntax). In other words, we examine database system capability to find the same query plan despite the syntactic approach.
